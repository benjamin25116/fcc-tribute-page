      <h2>Here's a brief timeline of Dr. Montessori's life</h2>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>1870 - Dr. Montessori was born on August 31, 1870 in Chiaravalle, Italy.</li>
          <li>1873 - The Montessori family moved to Florence in 1873 and then to Rome in 1875 because of her father's
            work.
          </li>
          <li>1883 - at the age of 13, Dr. Montessori entered a secondary, technical school, Regia Scuola Tecnica
            Michelangelo Buonarroti. She initially intended to pursue the study of engineering upon graduation, an
            unusual
            aspiration for a woman in her time
            and place. However, by the time she graduated in 1890 at the age of 20, with a certificate in
            physics–mathematics, she
            had decided to study medicine instead, an even more unlikely pursuit given cultural norms at the time.</li>
          <li>1896 - Dr. Montessori worked with and researched so-called "phrenasthenic" children—in modern
            terms, children experiencing some form of mental retardation, illness, or disability.</li>
          <li>1901 - Dr. Montessori left the Orthophrenic School and her private practice, and in 1902 she enrolled in
            the
            philosophy degree course at the University of Rome. </li>
          <li>1906 - Started the Case dei bambini in San Lorenzo, Rome.</li>
          <li>1909 - International recognition and growth of Montessori education</li>
          <li>1915 - Dr. Montessori returned to Europe and took up residence in Barcelona, Spain. Over the next 20 years
            she traveled and lectured widely in Europe and gave numerous teacher training courses. Montessori
            education experienced significant growth in Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Italy.</li>
